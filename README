Werder - Meaningless gibberish generator
----------------------------------------

This module is used to create pronounceable yet completely
meaningless language.  It is good for sending to a text-
to-speech program (ala festival), generating passwords,
annoying people on irc, and all kinds of fun things.

This new release is a full rewrite of the engine.  It is
based on grammar files derived from real text of real lan­
guages.  Several grammars are provided for you to use, and
you can also create your own.


Sample code:

  use Silly::Werder;

  my $werds = new Silly::Werder;

  # Set the min and max number of werds per line
  $werds->set_werds_num(5, 9);

  # Set the min and max # of syllables per werd
  $werds->set_syllables_num(3, 7);

  # End the sentences in a newline
  $werds->end_with_newline(1);

  # Set the language to mimic
  $werds->set_language(English, small);

  # Return a random sentence, question, or exclamation
  $line = $werds->line;

  $sentence    = $werds->sentence;
  $question    = $werds->question;
  $exclamation = $werds->exclamation;

  # Get a single werd
  $werd = $werds->get_werd;

  # Generate a long random sentence calling as a class method
  Silly::Werder->set_werds_num(10,20);
  print Silly::Werder->line;

  # All of the methods can be used as either class methods
  # or object methods.
