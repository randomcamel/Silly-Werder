Werder - Meaningless gibberish generator
----------------------------------------

This module is used to create pronouncable yet completely meaningless 
language.  It is good for sending to a text-to-speech program 
(ala festival), generating passwords, annoying people on irc, and all 
kinds of fun things.


Sample code:

  use Silly::Werder;

  my $foo = new Silly::Werder;

  # Set the min and max number of werds per line  $foo->set_werds_num(5, 9);

  # Set the min and max # of syllables per werd
  $foo->set_syllables_num(3, 7);

  # Set the percentage of the time a werd will start with a consonant
  $foo->set_cons_weight(75);

  # Return a random sentence, question, or exclaimation
  $line = $foo->line;

  $sentence = $foo->sentence;
  $question = $foo->question;
  $question = $foo->exclaimation;

  # Generate a long random sentence calling as a class method
  Silly::Werder->set_werds_num(10,20);
  print Silly::Werder->line;

  # All of the above methods can be used as either class methods
  # or object methods.
